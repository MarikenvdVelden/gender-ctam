## Pre-Registration Plan
* [PAP](docs/pap/pap.pdf) The theoretical underpinnings and research design to test the implications of being a woman, compared to being a man, using computational social sciences (_hypotheses 1--2_).

## Data
The following data files might be of interest:

* [Expert Survey ](data/intermediate/clean_data.RData) Cleaned data with constructed variables for analysis of the observational study in which we test whether women "play it safe" in the field of computational social sciences (_hypothesis 1_), and/or embrace the so-called Mathilda Effect (_hypotheses 2_).

See the scripts in [src/data-processing](src/data-processing/prep_data.md) for details on how these files were constructed.

## Results
* [Expert Survey](src/analysis/analyses.md) Demonstrates the analyses to test and visualise hypothesis 1 and hypothesis 2. In addition, we report the exploratory results for:
